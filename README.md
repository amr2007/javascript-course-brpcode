# My JavaScript Course ðŸš€

This repo is my personal journey of learning JavaScript from YouTube.  
Each folder here is one chapter of the course, so I can track my progress step by step.  

## Why this repo exists
- To keep all my practice code organized in one place  
- To see my growth as I move from basics to advanced concepts  
- To remind myself that consistency beats perfection  

## Progress so far
âœ… Chapters 1â€“8 completed  
ðŸ”œ Next: Chapter 9  

## Notes to myself
- Donâ€™t rush. One chapter at a time is enough.  
- Commit after finishing each chapter â€” this way GitHub becomes my progress tracker.  
- Remember: Even small steps daily add up to something big.
